      "Abstract Objective To examine the associations of vegetarianism with risks of ischaemic heart disease and stroke. Design Prospective cohort study. Setting The EPIC-Oxford study, a cohort in the United Kingdom with a large proportion of non-meat eaters, recruited across the country between 1993 and 2001. Participants 48 188 participants with no history of ischaemic heart disease, stroke, or angina (or cardiovascular disease) were classified into three distinct diet groups: meat eaters (participants who consumed meat, regardless of whether they consumed fish, dairy, or eggs; n=24 428), fish eaters (consumed fish but no meat; n=7506), and vegetarians including vegans (n=16 254), based on dietary information collected at baseline, and subsequently around 2010 (n=28 364). Main outcome measures Incident cases of ischaemic heart disease and stroke (including ischaemic and haemorrhagic types) identified through record linkage until 2016. Results Over 18.1 years of follow-up, 2820 cases of ischaemic heart disease and 1072 cases of total stroke (519 ischaemic stroke and 300 haemorrhagic stroke) were recorded. After adjusting for sociodemographic and lifestyle confounders, fish eaters and vegetarians had 13% (hazard ratio 0.87, 95% confidence interval 0.77 to 0.99) and 22% (0.78, 0.70 to 0.87) lower rates of ischaemic heart disease than meat eaters, respectively (P<0.001 for heterogeneity). This difference was equivalent to 10 fewer cases of ischaemic heart disease (95% confidence interval 6.7 to 13.1 fewer) in vegetarians than in meat eaters per 1000 population over 10 years. The associations for ischaemic heart disease were partly attenuated after adjustment for self reported high blood cholesterol, high blood pressure, diabetes, and body mass index (hazard ratio 0.90, 95% confidence interval 0.81 to 1.00 in vegetarians with all adjustments). By contrast, vegetarians had 20% higher rates of total stroke (hazard ratio 1.20, 95% confidence interval 1.02 to 1.40) than meat eaters, equivalent to three more cases of total stroke (95% confidence interval 0.8 to 5.4 more) per 1000 population over 10 years, mostly due to a higher rate of haemorrhagic stroke. The associations for stroke did not attenuate after further adjustment of disease risk factors. Conclusions In this prospective cohort in the UK, fish eaters and vegetarians had lower rates of ischaemic heart disease than meat eaters, although vegetarians had higher rates of haemorrhagic and total stroke. Introduction Vegetarian and vegan diets have become increasingly popular in recent years, partly due to perceived health benefits, as well as concerns about the environment and animal welfare. 1 In the United Kingdom, both the representative National Diet and Nutrition Survey 2008-12 and a 2016 Ipsos MORI survey estimated about 1.7 million vegetarians and vegans living in the country. 2 3 Evidence suggests that vegetarians might have different disease risks compared with non-vegetarians, 4 but data from large scale prospective studies are limited, because few studies have recruited sufficient numbers of vegetarian participants. For ischaemic heart disease, some but not all previous studies reported significantly lower risks of mortality from ischaemic heart disease in vegetarians than in non-vegetarians. 5 6 7 In terms of incidence, the only previous study (the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer (EPIC)-Oxford) reported that vegetarians had a lower risk of ischaemic heart disease than non-vegetarians, 8 but at the time of publication the study had an insufficient duration of follow-up to separately examine the risks in other diet groups (fish eaters and vegans). For stroke, two previous reports, 5 6 including one that included EPIC-Oxford data, 6 found no significant differences in risk of total stroke deaths between vegetarians and non-vegetarians. However, no previous studies have examined the incidence of stroke in relation to vegetarian diets, or have examined the main stroke types. We report here the risks of both incident ischaemic heart disease and stroke in people with distinct dietary habits—that is, meat eaters, fish eaters and vegetarians (including vegans)—with a separate evaluation of ischaemic and haemorrhagic strokes, over 18 years of follow-up in the EPIC-Oxford study. Methods Study population and design EPIC-Oxford is a prospective cohort study of about 65 000 men and women who were recruited across the UK between 1993 and 2001. Details of the recruitment process have been described previously. 9 Individuals were recruited from either general practices or by postal questionnaire. The general practice recruitment method recruited 7421 men and women aged 35 to 59 who were registered with participating general practices, all of whom completed a full questionnaire on their diet, lifestyle, health characteristics, and medical history. The postal recruitment preferentially targeted vegetarians, vegans, and other people interested in diet and health, and recruited 57 990 participants aged 20 or older. A full questionnaire was mailed to all members of the Vegetarian Society and all surviving participants of the Oxford Vegetarian Study, 10 and respondents were invited to provide names and addresses of relatives and friends who were also interested in receiving a questionnaire. A short questionnaire was also distributed to all members of the Vegan Society, enclosed in vegetarian and health food magazines, and displayed in health food shops; and a full questionnaire was subsequently mailed to all those who returned the short questionnaire. Despite the targeted recruitment of the postal method, about 80% of meat eaters in the cohort were recruited by post. Subsequently, a follow-up questionnaire was sent to participants in 2010, which asked similar questions on their diet and lifestyle, and participants returned the questionnaires between 2010 and 2013. A participant flowchart of the recruitment process and inclusion into this study is shown as supplementary figure 1. The study protocol was approved by a multicentre research ethics committee (Scotland A Research Ethics Committee) and all participants provided written informed consent. Assessment of diet group and diet The full baseline questionnaire collected responses to four questions about consumption of meat, fish, dairy products, and eggs, in the form of “Do you eat any meat (including bacon, ham, poultry, game, meat pies, sausages)?” or similar for the other three food groups. These four questions were used to classify participants into meat eaters (participants who reported eating meat, regardless of whether they ate fish, dairy, or eggs), fish eaters (participants who did not eat meat but did eat fish), vegetarians (participants who did not eat meat or fish, but did eat one or both of dairy products and eggs), and vegans (participants who did not eat meat, fish, dairy products, or eggs). The follow-up questionnaire sent in 2010 included identical questions on consumption of meat, fish, dairy products, and eggs (yes/no). Therefore, at both baseline and follow-up, participants were classified into one of four diet groups: meat eaters, fish eaters, vegetarians, and vegans. Owing to the small number of vegans, vegetarians and vegans were combined as one diet group in the main analyses, but the two groups were examined separately for each outcome in secondary analyses. The baseline questionnaire also included a semiquantitative food frequency section containing 130 items, which asked about dietary intake over the past year, and which was previously validated using 16 days (in four sets of four days) of weighed dietary records and selected recovery and concentration biomarkers. 11 12 13 For calculation of food and nutrient intakes, the frequency of consumption of each food or beverage was multiplied by a standard portion size (mostly based on data from the UK Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries, and Food) 14 and nutrient content of each food or beverage (based on McCance and Widdowson’s food composition tables). 15 Because our prespecified analysis plan was to examine disease risks associated with distinct dietary groups, the associations of individual foods and nutrients with risks were not assessed in this study, but information on intakes of foods and nutrients were used in descriptive and secondary analyses. Assessment of other characteristics In addition to diet, the baseline questionnaire also asked questions on sociodemographic characteristics, lifestyle, and medical history, including questions on education level, smoking, physical activity, use of dietary supplements, and use of oral contraceptives or hormone replacement therapy in women. Socioeconomic status was categorised by use of the Townsend deprivation index, 16 based on the participants’ postcodes. For physical activity, based on their responses to questions asked about their occupation and their time spent participating in activities including walking, cycling, and other physical exercises, participants were categorised by a validated physical activity index with four levels. 17 Alcohol consumption was determined from responses to five items on the food frequency questionnaire. Questions relating to smoking and alcohol consumption were also asked on the follow-up questionnaire in 2010. For biological measurements, body mass index was calculated from participants’ self reported height and weight at recruitment, which was previously found to be accurate compared with measured height and weight in a validation study of about 4800 participants. 18 All participants were also asked at recruitment whether they were willing to have their blood pressure measured at their general practice and to provide a blood sample. Details of the procedures for blood pressure measurement and blood sample collection, which were conducted in subsets of the cohort, have been previously reported. 8 19 20 Outcome ascertainment Participants were followed up via record linkage to records from the UK’s health service up to 31 March 2016. Outcomes of interest were ischaemic heart disease (codes 410-414 from ICD-9 (international classification of diseases, 9th revision) or codes I20-I25 from ICD-10), including acute myocardial infarction (ICD-9 410 or ICD-10 I21); and total stroke (ICD-9 430-431, 433-434, 436; or ICD-10 I60-I61, I63-I64), including ischaemic stroke (ICD-9 433-434 or ICD-10 I63) and haemorrhagic stroke (ICD-9 430-431 or ICD-10 I60-I61). Details of events, using the relevant ICD-9 or ICD-10 codes, were obtained from hospital records or death certificates. Exclusion criteria Participants who were not resident in England, Wales, or Scotland (n=945) were excluded, as were those with no Hospital Episode Statistics data or NHS number (n=20). We also excluded participants who completed the short questionnaire only (n=7619); were younger than 20 (n=1) or older than 90 at recruitment (n=58); had no follow-up (were censored at or before the date of recruitment (eg, if they were living abroad), n=364); could not be traced by the NHS (n=14); had an unknown diet group (if they did not answer the relevant questions to be classified, n=132); had unreliable nutrient data (≥20% of food frequencies missing, or daily energy intakes <500 kcal or >3500 kcal for women or <800 kcal or >4000 kcal for men (1 kcal=4.18 kJ=0.00418 MJ), n=1219); had a self reported history of acute myocardial infarction, stroke, or angina at recruitment (n=6837); or had a date of diagnosis that preceded or equalled the date of recruitment (n=14). Statistical analyses Baseline characteristics and food and nutrient intakes of the EPIC-Oxford participants were summarised by diet group. For self reported body mass index, and measures of blood pressure (systolic and diastolic blood pressure) and blood lipids (total cholesterol, high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), non-HDL-C), the means and 95% confidence intervals are presented, after adjustment for sex and age at entry (in 5-year age groups), alcohol consumption (<1, 1-7, 8-15, ≥16 g/day), and physical activity (inactive, low activity, moderately active, very active, unknown). 17 Cox proportional hazards regression models were used to estimate the hazard ratios and 95% confidence intervals for the associations between diet group (meat eaters, fish eaters, vegetarians including vegans) and each outcome of interest, with meat eaters as the reference group. For participants who completed both the baseline and follow-up questionnaire, diet group and relevant time varying covariates (smoking and alcohol consumption) were updated at follow-up. The underlying time variable was the age at recruitment to the age at diagnosis, death, or administrative censoring, whichever occurred first. For acute myocardial infarction or ischaemic heart disease, events were censored on the respective outcomes of interest. For total stroke, ischaemic stroke, and haemorrhagic stroke, events were censored on any stroke. All analyses were stratified by sex, method of recruitment (general practice or postal), and region (seven regions across the UK), and adjusted for year of recruitment (per year from 1994 to 1999), education (no qualifications, basic secondary (eg, O level), higher secondary (eg, A level), degree, unknown), Townsend deprivation index (quarters, unknown), 16 smoking (never, former, light, heavy, unknown), alcohol consumption (<1, 1-7, 8-15, ≥16 g/day), physical activity (inactive, low activity, moderately active, very active, unknown), dietary supplement use (no, yes, unknown), and oral contraceptive use (no, yes ever, unknown) and hormone replacement therapy use (no, yes ever, unknown) in women. We used Wald tests to test for heterogeneity of risk between diet groups. The proportional hazards assumption was assessed on the basis of Schoenfeld residuals, and was not violated for the variables of interest in the adjusted model for either ischaemic heart disease or stroke (P>0.05 for all categories). \n"

      "Researcher: Fiber's effects on cholesterol levels and blood lipid profiles are indeed fascinating, and there are several mechanisms by which it exerts its benefits.\n",
      "\n",
      "One key mechanism is through its ability to bind to bile acids in the gut and increase their excretion, a process known as bile acid sequestration. This reduces the amount of bile acids available for reabsorption in the small intestine, which in turn reduces the amount of cholesterol produced in the liver. As a result, the liver increases the production of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, the \"good\" cholesterol that helps remove excess cholesterol from the bloodstream.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another mechanism by which fiber affects cholesterol levels is by slowing down the absorption of dietary cholesterol and fat in the small intestine. This is due to fiber's ability to form a gel-like substance in the gut, which can trap fat and cholesterol molecules, making it harder for them to be absorbed into the bloodstream. This can help reduce the amount of cholesterol that enters the bloodstream and ultimately reduce LDL cholesterol levels.\n",
      "\n",
      "Journalist: That's a great explanation! So, it's a two-pronged approach: fiber's ability to bind to bile acids and reduce cholesterol production in the liver, and its ability to slow down the absorption of dietary cholesterol and fat in the small intestine. That makes sense.\n",
      "\n",
      "I'd like to follow up on the type of fiber that's most beneficial in this regard. You mentioned that fiber from whole grains, legumes, and fruits and vegetables is beneficial. Are there any specific types of fiber that are particularly potent in terms of cholesterol-lowering effects? For example, are soluble fiber-rich foods like oats, barley, and psyllium more effective than insoluble fiber-rich foods like wheat bran and corn bran?\n",
      "\n",
      "Also, are there any specific food sources that are particularly high in these types of fiber that you would recommend for people looking to incorporate more fiber into their diet?\n",
      "\n",
      "Researcher: Yes, the type of fiber can make a difference in its cholesterol-lowering effects. Soluble fiber, in particular, has been shown to be more effective in reducing cholesterol levels.\n",
      "\n",
      "Soluble fiber is found in foods such as oats, barley, psyllium, and some fruits and vegetables, like apples, berries, and carrots. Soluble fiber forms a gel-like substance in the gut that can trap bile acids and cholesterol, making it harder for them to be reabsorbed into the bloodstream. This can help reduce cholesterol levels by reducing the amount of cholesterol produced in the liver.\n",
      "\n",
      "In contrast, insoluble fiber, found in foods like wheat bran and corn bran, is not as effective in reducing cholesterol levels. This is because insoluble fiber does not form a gel-like substance in the gut and is not as effective at trapping bile acids and cholesterol.\n",
      "\n",
      "Journalist: So, soluble fiber is the key player in cholesterol-lowering effects, and foods like oats, barley, psyllium, and certain fruits and vegetables are good sources of soluble fiber.\n",
      "\n",
      "Can you recommend some specific food sources of soluble fiber that people can incorporate into their diet to increase their fiber intake and potentially lower their cholesterol levels? For example, are there any particular types of fruits or vegetables that are particularly high in soluble fiber?\n",
      "\n",
      "Also, are there any specific serving sizes or portions that people should aim for to get the beneficial effects of soluble fiber on cholesterol levels?\n",
      "\n",
      "Researcher: Yes, here are some specific food sources of soluble fiber that you can incorporate into your diet:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Oats: Steel-cut oats, rolled oats, and oatmeal are all good sources of soluble fiber. Aim for 1/2 cup cooked oats per serving.\n",
      "2. Barley: Pearl barley, whole barley, and barley flakes are all good sources of soluble fiber. Aim for 1/2 cup cooked barley per serving.\n",
      "3. Psyllium: Psyllium husk is a type of soluble fiber that can be found in many health food stores or online. Aim for 1-2 tablespoons per day.\n",
      "4. Fruits: Berries, apples, bananas, and pears are all good sources of soluble fiber. Aim for 1-2 cups per day.\n",
      "5. Vegetables: Carrots, sweet potatoes, and avocados are all good sources of soluble fiber. Aim for 1-2 cups per day.\n",
      "\n",
      "In terms of serving sizes, aim for the following daily intake:\n",
      "\n",
      "* 25-30 grams of fiber per day for women\n",
      "* 30-38 grams of fiber per day for men\n",
      "\n",
      "You can achieve this by incorporating a variety of fiber-rich foods into your diet, such as whole grains, fruits, vegetables, and legumes.\n",
      "\n",
      "Some specific serving sizes to aim for include:\n",
      "\n",
      "* 1 cup cooked oatmeal with fruit and nuts\n",
      "* 1/2 cup cooked barley with vegetables and herbs\n",
      "* 1/2 cup cooked psyllium husk with water or juice\n",
      "* 1 medium apple with skin\n",
      "* 1 medium banana\n",
      "* 1 medium pear\n",
      "* 1 cup mixed berries\n",
      "* 1 medium carrot\n",
      "* 1 medium sweet potato\n",
      "* 1 medium avocado\n",
      "\n",
      "Remember to increase your fiber intake gradually to allow your gut microbiome to adjust. Aim to increase your fiber intake by 5-10 grams per day every few days until you reach your target intake.\n",
      "\n",
      "Journalist: Thank you for providing specific food sources and serving sizes for soluble fiber. It's great to have concrete recommendations for incorporating more fiber into one's diet.\n",
      "\n",
      "I'd like to follow up on the topic of gut microbiome adjustment. You mentioned that it's important to increase fiber intake gradually to allow the gut microbiome to adjust. Can you elaborate on what happens when we suddenly increase our fiber intake, and why gradual adjustment is important?\n",
      "\n",
      "For example, when we suddenly introduce a large amount of fiber into our diet, does our gut microbiome struggle to break it down, leading to uncomfortable symptoms like bloating or gas? And if so, what are some strategies for managing these symptoms while our gut microbiome adjusts to the increased fiber intake?\n",
      "\n",
      "Researcher: When we suddenly increase our fiber intake, our gut microbiome can struggle to break it down, leading to uncomfortable symptoms like bloating, gas, and abdominal cramps. This is because the gut microbiome is a complex ecosystem that requires time to adapt to changes in the diet.\n",
      "\n",
      "When we eat a high-fiber diet, the gut microbiome needs to produce enzymes and metabolites to break down the fiber. However, if we suddenly introduce a large amount of fiber into our diet, the gut microbiome may not be able to keep up with the demand, leading to an imbalance in the gut microbiome.\n",
      "\n",
      "This imbalance can cause symptoms like bloating, gas, and abdominal cramps, which can be uncomfortable and even painful. Additionally, an imbalanced gut microbiome can also lead to changes in the gut-brain axis, which can affect our mood, energy levels, and overall health.\n"
