This hampers attempts to quantify the environmental impacts of urban agriculture or craft policies for sustainable food production in cities. To address this gap, we used a citizen science approach to collect data from 72 urban agriculture sites, representing three types of spaces (urban farms, collective gardens, individual gardens), in five countries (France, Germany, Poland, United Kingdom, and United States). We answered three key questions about urban agriculture with this unprecedented dataset: (1) What are its land, water, nutrient, and energy demands? (2) How productive is it relative to conventional agriculture and across types of farms? and (3) What are its contributions to local biodiversity? We found that participant farms used dozens of inputs, most of which were organic (e.g., manure for fertilizers). Farms required on average 71.6 L of irrigation water, 5.5 L of compost, and 0.53 m 2 of land per kilogram of harvested food. Irrigation was lower in individual gardens and higher in sites using drip irrigation. While extremely variable, yields at well-managed urban farms can exceed those of conventional counterparts. Although farm type did not predict yield, our cluster analysis demonstrated that individually managed leisure gardens had lower yields than other farms and gardens. Farms in our sample contributed significantly to local biodiversity, with an average of 20 different crops per farm not including ornamental plants. Aside from clarifying important trends in resource use at urban farms using a robust and open dataset, this study also raises numerous questions about how crop selection and growing practices influence the environmental impacts of growing food in cities. We conclude with a research agenda to tackle these and other pressing questions on resource use at urban farms. Working on a manuscript? Avoid the common mistakes 1 Introduction The environmental impacts of supplying food to cities are immense (Goldstein et al. 2017 ). Urban agriculture (UA) is often promoted as a means to reduce these impacts and simultaneously provide multi-functional health and well-being benefits (Gomez Villarino et al. 2021 ; Newell et al. 2022 ). UA is broadly defined as growing food in and around cities that interacts with urban areas through the exchange of materials, people, and values (Mougeot 2000 ). While there are many types of UA, ranging from gardens to advanced, hydroponic “plant factories,” we focus here on soil-based gardens and farms that cultivate vegetables and fruit, as these are most common (Cameron et al. 2012 ). An expected benefit of such systems is producing hyper-local, nutritious food for city residents. Nevertheless, growing food in cities requires water, energy, land, fertilizers, and pesticides (FAO 2011 ; Campbell et al. 2017 ; Mohareb et al. 2017 ) and can have negative environmental impacts. Understanding these inputs and impacts is key to ensuring that UA contributes to sustainable urban food systems. Little is known about the quantity of food produced by and the inputs used in UA, partly due to its diversity and sometimes informal nature. UA can have both very large or small yields and can be resource efficient or inefficient, yet the key factors that drive differences are unknown (CoDyre et al. 2015 ; McDougall et al. 2019 ). An accurate understanding of UA yields and inputs, such as water, fertilizer, and compost, is essential for evaluating its potential impacts on urban resource use and local food systems as the practice expands (Cohen and Wijsman 2014 ). Such evaluations support more accurate projections of the amounts and types of foods consumed in cities that can be provided by UA (Weidner et al. 2019 ; Grafius et al. 2020 ), and what resources are required to support food urban production. A proper material accounting of UA would also help clarify the effect of large-scale UA on the stocks and flows of material and energy that comprise a city’s “metabolism” (Barles 2009 ; Van Broekhoven and Vernay 2018 ) and help answer critical policy questions, such as the tractability of UA as a food supply in arid, water-stressed cities. In addition, increasing knowledge of UA yields and inputs for its different forms is necessary to conduct environmental footprinting of urban food production (Dorr et al. 2021 ). Data on resources used by urban farms are rarely collected because it is time consuming and often not standard farming practice (Whittinghill and Sarr 2021 ). Only a handful of studies provide detailed accounts of farm inputs, yields, and environmental impacts. This data gap forces researchers evaluating UA to use unrepresentative statistics from rural agriculture (McClintock et al. 2013 ; Aragon et al. 2019 ) or to estimate values for yield and input use based on secondary data (Dalla Marta et al.', 'role': 'user'}, {'content': 'Journalist:  [name], the study highlights the rapid growth of urban agriculture in cities across the global north. Why is it crucial to have data on its environmental impact, and what challenges does the lack of such data pose for sustainable urban food production?', 'role': 'user'}, {'content': \"Researcher:  Thank you for asking. Urban agriculture is often seen as a sustainable solution to reduce the environmental footprint of food systems in cities. However, without data on its environmental impact, it's challenging to assess whether it truly contributes to sustainability or if it introduces new environmental challenges. For instance, urban farms may use significant amounts of water, energy, or fertilizers, which could offset their benefits. Policymakers need this data to craft effective regulations and incentives, ensuring that urban agriculture aligns with broader sustainability goals.\", 'role': 'assistant'}, {'content': 'Journalist:  You mentioned that the study used a citizen science approach to collect data from 72 sites across five countries. Can you elaborate on how this approach was implemented and what key findings emerged regarding resource use and yields?', 'role': 'user'}]\n",
      "[{'content': 'Researcher:  Absolutely. Citizen science involved engaging urban farmers and gardeners themselves to collect data on their practices, such as water and fertilizer use, crop yields, and biodiversity. This approach ensured that the data were collected from real-world, diverse settings, which is often challenging with traditional research methods. We found that resource use and yields varied significantly among sites. For example, some urban farms used very little water, while others used substantial amounts, depending on management practices and local conditions. Interestingly, well-managed urban farms often exceeded the yields of conventional rural farms, highlighting the potential of urban agriculture to produce food efficiently.', 'role': 'assistant'}]\n"
